Tatsu’s Flight is a single-player fantasy arcade and adventure game about an Eastern dragon who is trying to escape from human captivity in a dark forest. The reason this game was chosen was because of the want to incorporate flying, shooting, and some essence of East Asian culture, and the dragon was chosen. The motivation behind the game is the representation of humanity’s need to dominate nature which is referred to as anthropocentrism, and nature’s inherent resistance to domination. Anthropocentrism is the philosophical view that humans are the most significant beings in the universe above everything else. The target users for the game are high school teenagers and up because this game isn’t intended for children since it could encourage violence towards animals at a young age and might be a little scary for them because they’re sensitive, and their brains are still developing.
The game world is based on multiple levels in the game, and the first level starts in the dark forest and then progresses to the mountains. The main character who is the escaping dragon, his obstacles will be knights from the kingdom that originally captured him. They’re trying to recapture him with arrows and flying swords. The rules of the game is to shoot fireballs by pressing the spacebar to kill the different knights, while you as the dragon are moving up and down to dodge their attacks. If you get hit by any of the flying arrows or swings of the sword, you lose one life. You have a total of lives per level, so if you lose all three lives in one level, you have to restart the level. There are also collectibles on each level. The player is given points for how many enemies they defeat and each collectible that’s found. The controls for the game are the up and down arrows to move and the spacebar to shoot fireballs to attack enemies. 
This is a rough sketch of what we wanted the game to look like.

Each team member divided up the development of the game. Wolf was the Project Lead and the Artist, so they developed a plan for us to follow and an outcome of how the game should look, and they drew all the sprites by hand and animated them in the game. Avery was the Story Writer and Programmer, so she wrote the storyline and programmed the main functions of the game. Xandria was the Sound Designer, so she designed all the sound effects and made them unique and fit the theme and context of the game.
	As the Project Lead and Artist, Wolf provided the original project pitch of the game which started everything off. Then, as mentioned earlier, helped divide the work for everyone to utilize their strengths effectively. Drawing and animating every asset by hand was an extremely time consuming effort that was done piece by piece over the months of the semester—the very first thing done was the sprite of the dragon and the forest background. Following that, Wolf made the island obstacles, other animations for the dragon and their fire, and then the other backgrounds. The enemy sprites were certainly the hardest things to make other than the dragon, as they required extensive animations for their attack cycles—especially the sword-wielding enemy, which required the most motion in their animation, and thus the most redrawing of each frame, of any other character. Finally, after weeks of making the sprites, Wolf moved on to the programming and implementation phase. Wolf imported all of the animations into Unity, converted them to a sprite sheet format so each individual frame could be recognized, and then added them all as animation objects in the assets. The last piece of the puzzle was coding the animator to trigger the proper animations for the dragon when the right conditions occurred.
As the Story Writer and Programmer, Avery created the storyline based on suggested elements from the rest of the team. Additionally, Avery coded the base for the full game. More specifically, Avery created each of the scenes seen in the game: Title Screen, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the Thank You/Closing Screen. Avery built the structure that Wolf used to implement their sprites and animations (base block sprites that had all the necessary components, just needed the artwork). Avery coded the movement and fireball shooting for the dragon, as well as creating them on Unity and adding all the necessary components (Rigidbody 2D, Box Collider 2D, etc.). Avery did this for most elements you see in the game: enemies, both crossbow and sword; projectiles; lives, or the hearts in the corner; and souls. Avery created the title and closing screens and the functional buttons used to start and quit the game. Avery coded the scripts so that upon reaching the flag at the end of the level, the next level is loaded and played. Avery coded the script that makes the game constantly scrolling to the left and the script for the camera to follow. Avery also did the scripts for the archers, making it so that the enemy fires in a straight line on a timer. The enemy projectiles will take a heart away upon collision with the “dragon” tag and will disappear upon collision with the “fireball” tag. User hits the spacebar to shoot fireballs, and upon collision with “projectile” and/or “enemy” tags, both objects will be destroyed. 
As the Sound Designer, Xandria created the sound effects using Voice Memos and the background music using GarageBand. Specifically for the dragon, Xandria created the roar for the dragon while it shoots fireballs, and Xandria also created the sound effect for if the dragon gets hit with a projectile. For the dragon sound effects, Xandria used a compilation of lion roars from YouTube and cut out specific sounds for the dragon. The sound effects for the knights were made using Xandria’s own voice in Voice Memos. The knight sound effects were for when the knight got hit with a fireball. For the background music, Xandria made different themes based on the different levels, the music keeps with the East Asian theme, and it turned out great. Xandria then implemented all the background music and sound effects in the game.

Developing Tatsu’s Flight was very time-consuming and challenging. Some challenges that we faced were finding time to do our respective roles and arranging time to discuss the project. We overcame these challenges by keeping the team updated on what we were doing in our specific roles, communicating our issues with each other, and utilizing our time management skills. In the future of this game, we would like to add some more levels with more complexity, add some cut scenes that tell more of the story of what the dragon is experiencing, and a store for collectibles in order to gain more power-ups to defeat more difficult enemies. Overall, this project was a very rewarding experience, and now we understand more of aspects of what goes into a game.
